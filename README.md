- [x] An interactive app that maps visual and acoustical output to user keystrokes.
- [x] Each keystroke triggers a certain graphic animation and an audio response to be generated.
- [x] The functionality is powered by the PaperJS and HowlerJS libraries.
- [x] Currently there are two versions of it: one with circle animations and one with random rectangle animations.
