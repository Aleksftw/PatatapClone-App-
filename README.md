#  Patatap clone  
---
Fun and interactive app that maps visual and acoustical output to user keystrokes! Each keystroke triggers a certain graphic animation and an audio response to be generated. This functionality is powered by the PaperJS and HowlerJS libraries. There are two versions of it: one with circle animations and one with random rectangle animations. As the name suggests, it is a clone of the patatap.com web-app, but cooler.
